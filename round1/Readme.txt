It has been while since I've used C/C++, and it felt good to get back into this.
There was a bunch of things I struggled to understand or get working.
A few things I struggled with:
* I was using the wrong compiler
* Converting c++11+ basic_string to be printable with printf
* How to do proper linking with makefiles
* Getting down a solid method of testing functions
*
